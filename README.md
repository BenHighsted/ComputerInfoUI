# ComputerInfoUI
Creating a user interface to show CPU/GPU temperatures and CPU usage. Also want to make it alert users when the temperature rises very high.

Currently planning to make it in either Python or C#. Want something that looks nice that I can leave running on my second monitor to keep track while playing games.
